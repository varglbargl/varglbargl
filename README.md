Hi. I'm a Software Engineer with a focus on acessibility in front-end web design—formerly at Apple, Bank of America, XPO Logistics—and an Artist at Games for Spiders making board games and video games.

If you'd like to see my full resume you can email me at vbargodale@gmail.com and if you'd like to see some of my design work for Games for Spiders, you're in luck! We made our first game, Flesh it Out, available for free [over on Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/games/flesh-it-out) so you can keep playing it from home while you stay safe out there.

My most recent projects include [diemad.online](https://diemad.online) (built entirely in vue.js), an upcoming unannounced board game aiming for a 2022 kickstarter, and an upcoming unannounced visual novel coming to Steam... eventually.
